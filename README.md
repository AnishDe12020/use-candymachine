# Use Candymachine Hook

`useCandymachine` is a [React Hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that provides a simple interface to interact with a [Candy Machine](https://docs.metaplex.com/programs/candy-machine/). It accepts a Candymachine ID (address) and a [Connection Object](https://solana-labs.github.io/solana-web3.js/classes/Connection.html) and then returns multiple functions and other state variables.

# Features

- Fetching a Candymachine
- Fetching nfts that belong to a Candymachine
- Pagination when fetching nfts that belong to a Candymachine

### Will be implemented

- A `mint` function that can be directly called to mint a NFT
- Cleaner code, things are a little here and there now. Let me know (via an issue) if you have any suggestions. Maybe I am going to split the main hook into multiple ones (and then have a main one) but didn't decide upon that yet.

... more stuff (open an issue if you wanna suggest something)
